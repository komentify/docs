# How to use

To add the comment component to your app you can either use one of our integration libraries or the simple `script` snippet. 

## Integration libraries

## Code snippet

The structure of the universally useable code snippet is like following:

```html
<script src="http://www.komentify.io/api/embed?appId={appId}&selectorId={elementId}"></script>
```

Add this to the end of your `<body>` tag and replace `{appId}` with the id you see in your dashboard and `elementId` with the wrapper element that the comment component should be placed in.
