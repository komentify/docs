# komentify FAQ

---

#### Why am I getting "Access denied" instead of the comment box?

The "access denied" message is usually appearing due to a misconfiguration within the dashboard of your website. Make sure your site configuration is correct, particularly the "Production URL" should match the URL of your site. For "Development URL" you might want to use "[http://localhost](http://localhost)" to run your website locally.

Further information: There is no need to set the port in case your website runs on a different port than 80.

#### How can I get rid of the ads?

On your website's dashboard is a "Referrals" section, which provides social media links you can use to promote komentify. Just three successful sign-ups are required to gain an ads-free experience for one of your websites. To disable ads for all of your websites a total of 10 referrals are needed.

#### When I use the meteor-comments-ui package, are my comments stored locally in my project or on your servers?

The meteor comments-ui package which is available on GitHub builds the grounds of komentify. The comments-ui package stores the data on your server or wherever your mongo database is hosted. Integrating komentify does not only provide a backend for you with customization possibilities, social media logins, etc. but stores the data on the komentify-servers.
