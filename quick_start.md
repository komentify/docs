# Quick Start

This is the 30 seconds guide to start using komentify on your own website.

* Create your account [on komentify](https://www.komentify.io/)
* Create a new website \(you should see the form now, otherwise [click here](https://www.komentify.io/apps/add)\)
* Put the script snippet into your website \(visible on the [dashboard](https://www.komentify.io/)\)
  * Don't forget to replace {elementId} with the id of the placeholder div for your widget
  * By default the URL is used to associate comments with a site, but you can provide a "siteId" parameter to make it URL independent \(more info [here](https://docs.komentify.io/howtouse.html)\)
